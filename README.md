# FJORD

Fjord is a tiny Windows native application for viewing images compressed by the FJORD fractal codec (based on partitioned iterated function systems). 

## About the Project

The resulting binary takes about 10 KiB disk size. And even lesser, about 8 KiB, if kkrunchy-k7 EXE packer from demoscene group Farbrausch is used.

## TODO

- [ ] Support for platforms other than x86
